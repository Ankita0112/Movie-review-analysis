## üé¨ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

### üìå Overview

This project implements a **Movie Review Sentiment Analysis** pipeline that uses **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** to classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative**. It aims to explore how text preprocessing and different models affect sentiment classification accuracy.

---

## üß† What I Did

* Collected and cleaned a dataset of movie reviews.
* Performed **text preprocessing** using NLTK (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
* Transformed text data into numerical format using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
* Trained and evaluated three different classification models:

  * **Logistic Regression**
  * **Random Forest Classifier**
  * **Naive Bayes**
* Compared model performance using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.
* Identified the **best performing model** based on evaluation metrics.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**

   * Load dataset of labeled movie reviews.
   * Inspect review distribution and length.

2. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Lowercasing
   * Tokenization using NLTK
   * Stopword removal
   * Lemmatization
   * Reconstructed cleaned reviews

3. **Feature Extraction**

   * Applied **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text into numerical feature vectors.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Split dataset into training and test sets.
   * Trained three models:

     * **Logistic Regression**
     * **Random Forest**
     * **Naive Bayes**
   * Evaluated using:

     * Accuracy Score
     * Confusion Matrix
     * Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## üîç Key Features & Insights

* **Text Normalization**: Cleaned and lemmatized raw user reviews for improved input quality.
* **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Captured important words without relying on word order.
* **Model Comparison**: Empirically compared classical ML classifiers to choose the most effective one.
* **Accuracy Results**: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes both showed strong performance, depending on the metric prioritized.
